# DecentSynth

An imitation synthesizer made in DecentSampler

## Features:

Two waveform shapes that act independently of each other

## TODO:

- [ ] Support all the effects available in DecentSampler

- [ ] Waveform modulation

- [ ] **More knobs/buttons**

## Why?

100% only because I was bored.

## License

The License for the DecentSynth.dspreset file is available in the [LICENSE.md file](LICENSE.md)
The License for all audio in this repository (the '.wav' and '.aup3' files) is CC0 if it needs a license, but I don't think the segments are long enough to have copyright
